<h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>
<p>The posts on this website are not academically-based. In addition to that, this is a social media website for archaeologits who are willing to share their colorful moments in their career. Any unauthorized post is prohibited. Any action considered as plagiarism would result in account banned and further disposition.</p>

<h3>Self Reflection</h3>

<p>I designed this website in a relatively simple way but with rich ideas. It's designed to be easy for users. On the other hand, users can interact with each other through multiple medias such as pictures, text and videos.</p> 

<p>The most challenging part is getting started, how to create a GitHub page? It took me a while to figure it out how to create this GitHub page. Some tutorials on the Internet are either too old or assuming readers having some knowledge of this website or coding in general. Also, considering the fact that this is just a prototype of a unfinished project, there is only little material published related to my project. So the webpage I designed might look a little dry. To solve these problems, more practice needs to be conducted.</p>

<p>What unique about this subject is it provides a platform for archaeologists to share their non-academical moment. It's like a socia media club for archaeologists. However, ethical issues need to be considered, what can or cannot be posted here? I think it depends on individual situation.</p>
