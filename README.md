Project Vastur is a platform for metal music fans from all over the world to share and write album reviews. It was launched by Vincent Ran on Oct. 5th 2017, he is a then growing online author of album reviews via multiple Chinese social media. This project was named after a fictional figure called "Hastur", which was pupularized through Cthulhu Mythos. In other words, the name "Vastur" is combination of "Hastur" and "Vincent".
